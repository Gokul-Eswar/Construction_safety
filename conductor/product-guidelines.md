# Product Guidelines: Industrial Geofencing Safety System

## Visual Interface & Design Principles
- **High-Contrast & Warning-Centric:** The interface must prioritize immediate recognizability. Bold colors—Red for danger/violations, Yellow for warnings, and Green for safe states—should be used alongside large, distinct indicators. Visual overlays on live feeds must ensure that alerts are the most prominent elements during a safety event.

## Alerting & Notification Tone
- **Authoritative & Direct:** System alerts must use imperative and concise language. Communication should be designed to command immediate action, using phrases like "STOP IMMEDIATELY" or "ZONE VIOLATION" to eliminate ambiguity during critical safety incidents.

## Data Handling & Auditability
- **Evidence-First & Detailed:** The system will prioritize the capture and storage of high-resolution image or video snapshots for every violation. This serves as critical evidence for forensic review, incident analysis, and liability protection.
- **Statistical & Trend-Focused:** Beyond individual incidents, the system will aggregate data to provide high-level safety metrics and heatmaps. This enables management to identify systemic risks and optimize site layouts for better safety.

## User Experience & Interaction
- **Instant Intervention:** The dashboard must facilitate "one-click" actions, such as manual machinery overrides or PA announcements, to allow safety officers to resolve threats the moment they are detected.
- **Deep Analysis:** Tools for zooming into feeds, replaying recorded events, and adjusting homography-based zone boundaries must be intuitive and performant.
- **Automated Monitoring:** The system is designed for high-autonomy operation, providing a "silent guardian" experience where human intervention is only demanded during critical exceptions, while maintaining constant background vigilance.
